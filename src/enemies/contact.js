/**
 * The contact shadow: the thing that puts a body ON the sand instead of over
 * it.
 *
 * WHAT THE DEFECT ACTUALLY WAS. This is worth writing down, because two review
 * rounds got it wrong in opposite directions - one claimed the enemies cast no
 * shadow, another measured a cast shadow and declared the complaint false, and
 * both were reading the same correct pixels.
 *
 * The enemies DO cast a real shadow. Every mesh has castShadow set, they sit
 * well inside the sun's 136 m ortho frustum, and an A/B against the identical
 * frame with casting disabled shows the shadow arriving at full strength: the
 * darkest shadowed texel drops 159 luma out of a 150-luma sunlit background,
 * which is total occlusion, not a bias artefact.
 *
 * The shadow is INVISIBLE FOR A GEOMETRIC REASON. The sun sits at 27 degrees of
 * elevation on a bearing of about 32 degrees off the avenue's axis, and the
 * player walks the avenue. So in essentially every combat frame the shadow lies
 * almost directly AWAY from the camera along the ground plane, is foreshortened
 * by the grazing view into a sliver, and what is left of it hides behind the
 * legs that cast it. Measured on the shipped build: at 7 m the whole cast
 * shadow is 3,555 pixels in a smear beside the feet; at 20 m it is 1,540
 * pixels, a hairline about forty pixels long. Under the feet - which is the
 * only place the eye looks for contact - there is nothing at all.
 *
 * Raising the shadow-map resolution cannot fix that. Neither can bias: dropping
 * normalBias to zero was tried and it TRIPLED the changed-pixel count while
 * HALVING the mean darkening, which is acne on the dunes, not shadow. The sun's
 * angle is a world-lighting decision that lives in sky.js and is not this
 * module's to make.
 *
 * So this is the other half: a projected contact patch, directly beneath the
 * actor, visible from every angle the sun's own shadow is not. It is the
 * ambient-occlusion term a body standing on sand should have and does not - the
 * darkening in the crook where two surfaces meet - and it is view independent
 * by construction.
 *
 * ON TRANSPARENCY. The standing rule is that enemy materials must not flip
 * `transparent` mid-run, because that forces a shader program swap on the exact
 * frame the player earns a kill. This material is created transparent, once, at
 * boot, and no code path ever changes that flag or any other pipeline state on
 * it. It is also SHARED by every actor - it carries no per-instance state, so
 * unlike the body materials there is nothing to make it per instance for - so
 * the whole horde costs one material and one program.
 *
 * It takes a FRACTION of the ground's own light rather than painting a colour
 * onto it, so the patch stays the sand's hue in sun and the chamber's hue
 * indoors and cannot become a grey disc on a warm floor. See the material for
 * why that is written as alpha blending toward black rather than as the
 * multiply blend it algebraically is.
