/**
 * The linen: generated albedo, relief and roughness for a bandaged corpse.
 *
 * WHY THE OLD COMMENT WAS WRONG
 *
 * The file this replaces argued that enemy materials should carry no maps at
 * all - "a 1K albedo on a 14 cm forearm would be four texture fetches for a
 * quarter of a texel" - and that shading plus silhouette would carry it. A
 * blind side-by-side then described the result as "flat untextured tan",
 * "Roblox mannequins", and put replacing them at the top of a five-item fix
 * list. The argument was about TEXEL DENSITY and the defect is about SURFACE:
 * an unmapped MeshStandardMaterial has exactly one value per lighting term
 * across a whole limb, so every member reads as painted plastic no matter how
 * good the silhouette is. Four fetches is the correct price.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY DRAWN, AND WHY EACH PART IS THERE
 *
 *   - BANDS. The read that matters. Wrapping is a stack of overlapping strips,
 *     and what says "bandaged" rather than "painted beige" is the repeating
 *     line where one strip laps the next: a dark seam with a bright lip above
 *     it. Sized at about 6 cm, which is a real bandage and, at the seven to
 *     twenty metres an enemy is fought at, three to seven pixels - wide enough
 *     to survive the mip chain rather than dissolving into grey.
 *   - PER-BAND TONE. Every strip gets its own value. Linen that has been buried
 *     for three thousand years does not discolour evenly, and a tone step
 *     between neighbouring strips is what makes the bands read as separate
 *     pieces of cloth instead of as a ruled pattern.
 *   - WEAVE. Fine warp and weft under everything. Sub-pixel past a few metres
 *     and that is fine: its whole job is to stop the flats being mathematically
 *     uniform up close and to give the mip chain something to average.
 *   - GRIME. Broad blotches and vertical stains, because the alternative to
 *     dirt is a clean mummy.
 *
 * THE VALUE IS HELD, DELIBERATELY.
 *
 * The palette was measured exhaustively - four candidate repaints scored
 * against identical background pixels - and darkening plus saturation LOST
 * legibility at four of five stances. An albedo map multiplies the material
 * colour, so a map whose mean is under white is a palette repaint smuggled in
 * as a texture. So the canvas is normalised: `WRAP_GAIN` is the map's mean in
 * LINEAR space (not sRGB - the mean of an sRGB image is not the mean of the
 * light it stands for), and the caller divides the palette colour by it. The
 * body then renders at the same average value it was measured at, with all of
 * the variation and none of the drift.
