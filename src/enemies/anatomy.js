/**
 * Bodies, not boxes: the geometry primitives a wrapped corpse is built from.
 *
 * WHY THIS LIVES HERE AND NOT IN world/geometry.js
 *
 * Two reasons, and the second is the load-bearing one.
 *
 * The first is that a character needs a shape the world does not: a TAPERED
 * member. Architecture is made of prisms - a course, a lintel, a drum - and a
 * prism is the right answer for all of them. A body is made of nothing else.
 * A thigh is thick at the hip and thin at the knee, a forearm narrows to a
 * wrist, and a torso is a wedge that is wide at the shoulders and narrow at the
 * waist. That single property is most of what separates a humanoid silhouette
 * from a mannequin's, and it is unavailable from a box.
 *
 * The second is DRAW CALLS. Twenty-four actors is the live cap, and at nineteen
 * meshes each that is 456 draw calls before the world has drawn a single stone.
 * Triangles are close to free here and draw calls are not, so this module is
 * built around an accumulator rather than a factory: you push as many members as
 * you like into one `parts()` and get ONE BufferGeometry out. Everything that
 * shares a rig group and a material collapses into a single mesh, which is how
 * this rebuild adds hands, feet, a neck, deltoids and tapered limbs and comes
 * out with FEWER draw calls than the box-man it replaces.
 *
 * The bevel is reimplemented here rather than imported. It is thirty lines, and
 * owning it means a change to the world's chamfer rule - which is tuned for a
 * forty-metre pyramid step - can never silently reshape a fourteen-centimetre
 * forearm.
 */

import * as THREE from 'three';

/**
 * How wide a bevel should be on a member of a given thickness.
 *
 * The world's rule scales with the LONGEST dimension and floors at 9 cm,
 * because it is sizing an arris on a stone course read from ninety metres. On a
 * limb that floor is the whole member. Here the bevel scales with the THINNEST
 * dimension and caps at 3.5 cm, which at the seven-to-twenty metres an enemy is
 * actually read from is two to four pixels: enough to hold a highlight, not
 * enough to turn an arm into a lozenge.

/**
 * An accumulator that welds many members into one geometry.
 *
 * Every member is generated in its own local frame, tapered, rotated,
 * translated, and appended to shared arrays. Normals are recomputed per
 * TRIANGLE from the final vertex positions, which keeps the flat shading that
 * makes a bevel read as a cut edge, and keeps it correct through the rotation.
 *
 * UVs are projected from the POST-transform position onto the dominant axis of
 * the post-transform normal. That is what makes a wrap line continue across a
 * shin and its foot instead of restarting at every member, and it is why the
 * bandage rings on a vertical limb come out horizontal without a UV pass: on
 * any side face the dominant axis is horizontal, so the texture's V runs with
 * world height.

/**
 * A torn wrap.
 *
 * WHAT THE STRIP THIS REPLACES GOT WRONG, MEASURED
 *
 * The wraps were modelled, believed, and never rendered. Photographed in
 * isolation at three angles they contributed ONE dark sliver at the hip and
 * nothing at all from the front or the side, and the figure read as an
 * articulated wooden mannequin. Four blind judges in four rounds named the
 * actors as the build's ceiling; the last said no lighting pass would fix it,
 * it was a material and silhouette problem. Three separate things were wrong
 * and every one of them alone was enough:
 *
 *   TOO NARROW. Authored at 12 to 13 cm and then multiplied by a taper that
 *   took the hem to as little as 36 per cent of that. At the fifteen metres an
 *   enemy is fought at, one metre is about 47 px in a 1000 px frame, so a 5 cm
 *   hem is TWO PIXELS. Under the mip chain that is not thin cloth, it is
 *   nothing.
 *
 *   INSIDE THE OUTLINE. Every strip hung plumb from a pivot inboard of the body
 *   it was attached to, so it could only ever draw over the torso and the
 *   thighs. A silhouette is the thing that identifies a figure at distance, and
 *   decoration painted inside one does not change it.
 *
 *   NO VALUE BREAK ALONG ITS LENGTH. One flat colour on a rag that hangs
 *   sometimes against sunlit limestone and sometimes against an unlit chamber
 *   will match one of them. What survives both is a strip carrying more than one
 *   value along its own length, so whatever is behind it, some part of the cloth
 *   is separated from it.
 *
 * SO: the profile widens rather than tapers and its two edges are cut
 * independently, the centre line WALKS SIDEWAYS as it falls so the hem finishes
 * clear of the vertical band the root occupies, a fold runs down the strip so it
 * has two faces to the sun instead of one, the out-of-plane curl is scaled off
 * the strip's LENGTH rather than its width, and three value bands are baked into
 * a colour attribute the tatter material reads.
 *
 * PER ROW, NOT PER VERTEX. Width, drift and curl are properties of a height on
 * a ribbon. The strip this replaces drew all three per vertex, which is what
 * turned a hanging wrap into torn confetti that averaged back out to a straight
 * edge. Only the hem tear stays per vertex, because each strand of a tear does
 * have its own length.
 *
 * `cut` seeds every decision, so a shape is stable across a run and shareable
 * between every instance that asks for the same one - which is what keeps the
 * pool at one BufferGeometry per (w, h, cut) no matter how deep it is.
