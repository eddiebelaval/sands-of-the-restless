/**
 * THE ONE ENEMY THAT DOES NOT LIVE ON THE FLOOR.
 *
 * THE HABIT THIS IS BUILT AGAINST is the same one the gold scarab already
 * exists to punish, one axis further out. variants.js says it plainly: by wave
 * fifteen the player has a single answer to everything, which is backpedal in a
 * circle and hold fire. The gold scarab moved the soft panel to the BACK, which
 * breaks the "hold fire" half. It did not touch the other half, because every
 * body in the roster still arrives along the floor, so the player's SEARCH is
 * still a horizontal sweep at eye level and it is still complete. An enemy that
 * comes down the wall behind them, or lets go of the ceiling over their head, is
 * the first thing in the game that a horizontal sweep does not find.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A FLOW FIELD PROBLEM, AND WHY IT GETS ITS OWN STEERING.
 * enemies/flow.js is a distance-to-player map over ONE floor, keyed on (x, z),
 * and its own header says what it drops: it cannot hold the gallery floor and
 * the bridge six metres over it at the same time. A body on a wall is not on
 * either. So nothing here reads the field: the crawler's whole route is three
 * legs, each of which is a straight line in a surface it is already stuck to.
 * That is enough because the legs are short - pick a wall inside 14 m, climb it,
 * cross the ceiling of ONE room - and a body that cannot solve a maze on a
 * ceiling is a body that gives up and drops, which is the behaviour we want
 * anyway.
 *
 * WHY AXIS-ALIGNED BOXES MAKE THIS SMALL. Every wall in the game comes out of
 * emitWall() in world/build.js as `{x, z, w, d, y0, y1}`, so a wall surface
 * normal is always one of four horizontal unit vectors and never anything else.
 * There is no mesh traversal here, no raycast, no contact solver: a face is a
 * fixed coordinate plus a clamped span, and "walking on it" is two scalars.
 *
 * WHAT THE CEILING IS. Also a wall record. buildShell() emits a room's side
 * walls from the floor to the ceiling in one box, so a full-height wall's `y1`
 * IS the room's ceiling height, and `topsOut()` below is what refuses the two
 * kinds of box whose top is not a ceiling - the breast under a doorway and any
 * wall with another wall stacked over it.
 *
 * THE HUNT CYCLE, which is the part that had to be designed rather than derived:
 *
 *   ground   ordinary floor pursuit, mummy.js's, untouched. After COOL_S with
 *            the player further off than MOUNT_MIN_M it goes looking for a wall.
 *   approach still on the floor, still under separation and avoid() and the
 *            wedge escape, but steering at a wall face instead of at the player.
 *   wall     climbing, drifting sideways toward the player's lateral position.
 *   coil     stopped dead at height, TURNED TO FACE THE PLAYER. The tell.
 *   leap     in the air on a committed ballistic arc.  <- THE PAYOFF
 *   roof     upside down, crossing to a point over the player. The fallback,
 *            taken when the player is not in the leap window.
 *   drop     lets go, falls under mummy.js's own gravity, rights itself.
 *
 * A crawler that only mounted a wall it happened to be jammed against would
 * almost never leave the floor, because its heading is by definition AWAY from
 * the wall and toward the player. The approach leg is the whole reason this
 * reads as an enemy doing something rather than as a physics accident.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE LEAP, AND WHY THE CLIMB HAD NO POINT WITHOUT IT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The owner, playing: "what if they run up the walls and jump at me? So they're
 * basically trying to get a good height so that they can jump on top of me."
 *
 * That is a diagnosis, not a feature request. As shipped, a wall was a ROUTE:
 * the only thing at the top of it was the ceiling, and the only thing the
 * ceiling did was carry the body to a point over the player's head where it let
 * go. Measured over 45 s in the Hall of Offerings, the crawler spent 28 per cent
 * of its life off the floor and the wall leg itself was pure transit - nothing
 * the player could answer happened on it, and nothing about being three metres
 * up was different from being on the ground except that the beetle was harder to
 * shoot. A climb whose payoff is a route is a climb the player has no reason to
 * look at.
 *
 * A LEAP MAKES THE HEIGHT THE POINT. The body gains altitude BECAUSE altitude
 * buys it a dive, the player can see the altitude being gained, and the dive is
 * the thing they have to answer.
 *
 * FOUR RULES HOLD IT INSIDE THIS GAME'S VOCABULARY, which is "you have one
 * second to answer this":
 *
 *   IT ANNOUNCES. COIL_S of a dead stop with the body turned off the climb to
 *   face the player. Nothing else in the roster stops moving at height, so the
 *   silhouette going still IS the telegraph, and it costs the player nothing to
 *   learn.
 *
 *   IT DOES NOT TRACK. The arc is solved once, at the instant of launch, against
 *   where the player IS. It is a thrown object from that frame on. A homing
 *   pounce is not a thing you can dodge, it is a thing you can only out-damage,
 *   and this game already has enough of those.
 *
 *   IT LAUNCHES FROM A WALL AND NEVER FROM THE ROOF. A dive that begins directly
 *   over the player's head is exactly the unblockable ambush this feature is one
 *   bad decision away from being. On a wall the arc is LATERAL, which means it
 *   crosses the player's field of view before it arrives.
 *
 *   AND IT LAUNCHES FROM FOUR METRES, NOT FROM SIXTEEN. LEAP_H caps the height,
 *   so a crawler in the Great Gallery does not plummet out of a 16 m ceiling at
 *   terminal velocity. The cap is what keeps the flight time long enough to be
 *   a beat rather than an event.
 *
 * IT LANDS AND THEN IT BITES, and the leap itself deals nothing. The whole
 * flight runs through mummy.js's `off` branch, which zeroes windup and strike
 * for exactly the reason a body on a ceiling must not bite through the roof. So
 * there is no second damage path here, systems/damage.js is untouched, and the
 * cost of being landed on is the ordinary bite with its ordinary wind-up.
