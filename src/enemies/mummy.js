/**
 * The shambling dead: geometry, animation, and the actor that drives them.
 *
 * NO SKINNING, NO LOADERS, NO BONES. A wrapped corpse is a stack of rigid
 * boxes on nested groups, and every joint is a rotation driven by a sine of the
 * walk phase. The reference project spends 25 bones and four IK layers on a
 * soldier and still reports that its characters "read as mannequins at
 * distance"; at twenty metres the thing that sells an undead is the SILHOUETTE
 * and the LURCH, neither of which needs a skeleton. What a skeleton would buy
 * us here is smooth deformation at the elbow, which is precisely the detail a
 * bandaged limb is supposed to hide.
 *
 * Three consequences fall out of that decision and all three are load bearing:
 *
 *   - The walk cycle is driven by REAL horizontal velocity, not a free-running
 *     timer. A staggered enemy's legs slow down with it, and one pinned against
 *     a pillar stops walking on the spot. A timer-driven cycle is the single
 *     loudest tell that a character is a puppet.
 *   - Geometry is shared across every instance of a variant. Twelve shamblers
 *     are twelve scene graphs pointing at one set of BufferGeometries, so the
 *     pool costs memory once no matter how deep it is.
 *   - Materials are NOT shared, because the hit flash is per instance. Five
 *     small MeshStandardMaterials per actor, allocated when the pool is built
 *     and never again.
 *
 * DEATH DOES NOT USE TRANSPARENCY. Flipping `transparent` on a live material
 * forces a program swap, which is a visible hitch at the exact moment the
 * player has earned a kill, and a transparent corpse also has to be depth
 * sorted against every other corpse. The topple ends in a sink through the
 * floor with a scale taper instead: opaque the whole way, no recompile, and it
 * reads as the body crumbling back into the sand.
 *
 * Every rate in this file is per second and multiplied by the clamped delta the
 * frame loop hands down.

 * WHY AVOIDANCE IS NOT ENOUGH, AND WHAT THE MISSING HALF IS.
 *
 * resolveAgainstWorld() has always returned whether it touched anything, and
 * its own doc says the caller uses that "to decide whether it is wedged and
 * should give up on its current heading". No caller ever read it. The hook
 * existed; the behaviour did not.
 *
 * The failure it was meant to catch, measured per frame on wave one: a shambler
 * pressed flat against the outside of the colonnade at (16.74, 30.34), holding
 * st.v at the full 2.25 m/s for 635 consecutive ticks and moving 0.000 m on 606
 * of them. It was ticked, it was pathing, it was not staggered, and it never
 * moved, because avoid() SUMS a sideways force per collider and the two discs
 * it was between - (15, 31.5) and (15, 29.1) - sat on opposite sides of its
 * heading. Their contributions cancelled to nothing. A continuous wall run is
 * built out of overlapping discs on purpose, so this is not a corner case on
 * this map: it is what walking into any wall square-on does.
 *
 * "Frozen" and "wedged" also look identical on screen, because the walk phase
 * is advanced by real horizontal velocity, so the actor stops animating too.
 *
 * The escape is a committed detour, not a per-frame nudge. Steering sideways
 * only while the wedge is detected produces a stutter: the moment it slides it
 * is making progress, the bias drops, and it turns back into the wall. So a
 * wedge opens a DETOUR with a fixed duration and a fixed hand, and the hand is
 * chosen by asking the map which way the obstacle ends.

 *   1. the LATERAL was one term - `torso.rotation.z = sin(p) * sway` - and it
 *      owned 68 per cent of the head's sideways travel over a stride. A raw
 *      sine applied at the waist is a metronome hung off a hinge: it moves
 *      FASTEST through the middle and dwells at the ends with no deceleration
 *      into either, which is the one thing a mass never does. Nothing below the
 *      waist moved at all, so the body did not shift its weight; it just leaned.
 *   2. every segment moved on ONE PHASE. Pelvis and chest rolled together and
 *      yawed together, and a body whose chest arrives at the same instant as
 *      its hips has no mass in it.
 *   3. the once-per-stride HITCH was symmetric - the same curve down as up - so
 *      the limp read as a bounce rather than as a leg giving way.
 *
 * The fixes are, in order: move the lateral DOWN into the pelvis and shape it
 * so it decelerates into each extreme; make the chest a lagged, reduced,
 * counter-rotating follower of the pelvis; and hang the vertical off each
 * foot's weight acceptance, asymmetrically, so the drop is faster than the
 * recovery and deeper on the bad leg.
 *
 * What did NOT change: the silhouette. Every anchor, width, tilt and value in
 * the wrap pass is untouched, and the arms, the wind-up and the strike are the

 * THE HIT REACTION, and it is the whole of why a shot lands or does not.

 * answer it at the impact point; the ACTOR has to answer it with its body, and
 * until this existed the answer was a scalar shiver that looked identical
 * whichever shoulder you put the round through.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ADDITIVE AND WHY IT RUNS LAST. Every joint above is ASSIGNED from
 * the gait, so a reaction written anywhere else in the file would be erased on
 * the next frame - which is the exact shape of the tatter-splay defect recorded
 * twenty lines up. Running last and adding means the flinch rides on whatever
 * pose the body was in, and a body caught mid-stride flinches out of a stride.
 *
 * WHAT IT DRIVES, in descending order of how much it contributes:
 *
 *   1. the STRUCK LIMB. A round through the left shoulder swings the left arm
 *      back and out. This is the single largest contributor to a hit feeling
 *      real, and it is animation - there is no particle system that substitutes
 *      for it.
 *   2. the SPINE TWIST. The struck side goes back and takes the chest with it,
 *      which is what carries the read at fifteen metres where an arm is four
 *      pixels wide but the whole outline is thirty.
 *   3. the TATTERS. They are the outline at range - see the note on the
 *      anchors - so whipping them is the cheapest distance-legible motion on
 *      the body.
 *   4. the HEAD, hard on a skull hit and slight otherwise.
 *   5. the WHOLE BODY, rocking off the impulse. This is what the old stagger
 *      did, kept, and now signed by the direction of the shot.
 *
 * Nothing here reads world space. `s.hitLX`, `s.hitF` and the rest arrive in the
 * actor's own frame, resolved at the moment of the hit; see registerHit.

 * comes back past the rest pose, and it settles" - is true of a struck spring
 * and false of a struck body, and the numbers say so. Measured on the shipped
 * build, one pistol round through a shoulder swung the head 44 px at eight
 * metres and REVERSED IT THREE TIMES on the way down, because the cosine takes
 * every joint in this reaction - the arm, the spine, the skull, the rags -
 * through zero and out the other side twice before the amplitude has decayed.
 * A body shot in the shoulder does not swing back through and out the far side
 * twice. It gives, and then it stops giving.
 *
 * It was also not delta-stable, which is the part that mattered on the machine
 * this note came from. The same round measured 43.9 px of head travel at the
 * 1/20 delta clamp and 64.7 px at 1/120, with one reversal against three: the
 * coarse step was skipping the peaks of a 2.5 Hz oscillation, so the reaction a
 * player saw depended on their frame rate. At 134 ms a frame it was sampling
 * about three times per cycle.
 *
 * What replaces it is a rise and a settle. The rise is there because a mass
 * takes a beat to reach its extreme rather than teleporting there on the frame
 * the round lands - and it is written as a pure function of AGE rather than as
 * an integrator, so a 50 ms step cannot overshoot it. At the delta clamp the
 * rise is done on the first frame, so nothing is lost on slow hardware; at 120

     *     frame, taken through its own yaw, and a shambler tracks the player
     *     continuously. The same world-space round arriving half a second later
     *     maps to a different local sideways because the body rotated underneath
     *     it.
     *
     * So the sign flipped round to round, each new lurch cancelled and reversed
     * the one still settling, and a body being shot rocked left-right-left

     * The blend weights the incoming direction by how much of the previous
     * lurch is LEFT. Mid-lurch, `st.stagger` is near one and the established
     * direction dominates, so a new round deepens the push it is already in.
     * Once the body has settled, `st.stagger` is near zero and the new round
     * sets the direction outright, exactly as before. Nothing is clamped and no

   *
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * WHAT THE EMISSIVE FLOOR NOTE ABOVE GOT RIGHT, AND THE ONE CASE IT MISSED
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * EMISSIVE_FLOOR ends with a sentence that is correct for every body it was
   * measured on and wrong for exactly one: "It goes on the linen and the rags
   * only. `deep` stays a void ... and `accent` is metal that already catches a
   * highlight." True of a shambler, whose accent is a strip of gilding on a
   * dark linen body that carries its own floor. Not true of a gold scarab,
   * whose accent IS the carapace, the jaws and the entire read of the enemy -
   * so the one material that was excluded from the floor is the only one that
   * variant has.
   *
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * WHY A METAL GOES BLACK IN A ROOM, WHICH IS NOT A PALETTE PROBLEM
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * A MeshStandardMaterial's diffuse term is albedo x (1 - metalness). At the
   * palette's measured 0.90 the shell keeps one tenth of its own colour under a
   * point light and takes the other nine tenths off the environment - and the
   * environment INDOORS is `INTERIOR_ENV = 0.05` in systems/spaces.js, not the
   * 0.17 main.js sets for the courtyard. Three and a half times less than the
   * number anybody quotes, on the material that needs it most.
   *
   * Measured with test/goldscarab.mjs, which photographs the beetle twice and
   * keeps the pixels that changed, so these are the beetle and not the room.
   * One actor, one pose, repainted in place; the sweep's last row repaints the
   * shipped values and came back BYTE-IDENTICAL to the first, so the column is a
   * true A/B and not eight different stagings:
   *
   *                     INTERIOR (wall p50 53.8)      COURTYARD (sand p50 146.7)
   *                     p50    vs wall   sat   sd     p50    vs sand   sat
   *     shipped         21.4    -32.4   0.72  24.3    85.5    -61.2   0.67
   *     glow 0.08       58.9     +5.1   0.69  21.2   105.3    -41.4   0.65
   *     glow 0.18       93.8    +40.0   0.66  28.0   126.2    -20.5   0.62
   *     glow 0.30      122.7    +68.9   0.63  37.7   142.0     -4.7   0.59
   *     glow 0.45      148.7    +94.9   0.59  47.6   160.2    +13.5   0.56
   *     metal 0.55      59.4     +5.6   0.67  21.6   140.8     -5.9   0.61
   *
   * THE SHIPPED ROW IS THE BUG IN ONE NUMBER: 21.4 against a wall at 53.8. The
   * beetle is two and a half times DARKER than the stone behind it. "Black with
   * blue eyes" is not an impression, it is the histogram.
   *
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * WHY THE PALETTE'S 0.90 / 0.26 IS NOT TOUCHED
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * The obvious fix is to stop pretending it is a mirror and drop metalness so
   * the point lights can light it. It was tried and it is on the table above:
   * metalness 0.55 lands the shell at 59.4 against a wall at 53.8. It does not
   * fix the beetle, it just moves it onto the wall's own value, which is the
   * OTHER way to be invisible and is the exact failure the EMISSIVE_FLOOR sweep
   * rejected 0.11 for. So the measured decision in variants.js stands unchanged
   * at 0.90 / 0.26. Nothing here overrules it.
   *
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * WHY IT IS GATED ON THE ROOM, AND NOT A CONSTANT
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * Look at the last column. A floor big enough to fix the chamber - 0.30, which
   * buys +68.9 of separation from the wall - costs the COURTYARD almost all of
   * its: the beetle goes from 61 luma below the sand to 4.7 below it, which is
   * the same beetle disappearing into a different background. A constant cannot
   * satisfy both, because the two spaces differ by 3.4x in the very term the
   * material is made of.
   *
   * `ctx.walls` is the signal, and it is not a new one: variants.js already
   * documents that it is populated for the interior's room shells and null in
   * the courtyard and the quarry, and the wall crawl is opt-in on exactly that
   * basis. So a gold scarab inside gets the floor, a gold scarab outside is the
   * enemy it always was - and the exterior column of that table is byte-identical
   * to shipped by construction rather than by measurement.
   *
   * ONE WRITE PER FRAME PER ACTOR, next to setFlash for the same reason: both
   * are properties of the room the body is in this frame rather than of the body,
   * and a spawn-time write would be wrong the moment anything alive crosses a
   * threshold.

     * question and was, for the whole life of this file, the answer given to the
     * first. In one open courtyard those are the same question. In a room graph
     * they stop being the same question the moment the player is through a
     * doorway that is not straight ahead, and everything below this line -
     * separation, avoidance, the committed detour - is LOCAL and cannot tell you
     * about a door it is not already facing.
     *
     * So the heading is seeded from the flow field when the field has an answer
     * for where this body is standing, and from the straight line when it does
     * not. See enemies/flow.js. The field is a distance-to-player map over the
     * live space and the direction is its downhill gradient, which in open
     * ground IS the straight line to within a fraction of a degree, and around a
     * corner is the way round the corner.
     *
     * NOTHING ELSE IN THIS FUNCTION CHANGES, and that is the point. The steering
     * that follows was tuned against bodies pushing past each other and grinding
     * along stone, it is good at that, and it is now being handed a heading that
     * is worth following instead of one that walks into a wall. Long-range
     * routing and last-metre clearance were always two jobs; only the first one
     * was missing.
     *
     * THE BLEND BACK TO THE STRAIGHT LINE INSIDE FADE_M is not cosmetic. The
     * field is rebuilt on a throttle - see updateFlow in director.js - so at any
     * instant it points at where the player was up to two cells ago. Over twenty
     * metres that is nothing. In melee it is the difference between a strike
     * that lands and one that swings through the air beside them, so the last
     * few metres are walked on the live position the way they always were.

     * fallback: sample() returns false and the body walks the bearing to the
     * player, through whatever is in the way. That is the right answer for one
     * actor standing somewhere odd. It is the wrong answer for the case that
     * actually shows up, which is EVERY actor failing at once because the field
     * itself died, and it is the reported symptom - mummies coming at the player
     * in a straight line, through walls, and grinding on the far side of them.
     *
     * Measured on this build with the player standing in the west bay-1 chapel
     * recess: 16,648 of 16,648 sample() calls failed for seventy seconds, every
     * live actor fell through to this line, and the worst of them spent 79 per
     * cent of its life pushing into stone.
     *
     * The flood is flow.js's to fix and the note for whoever fixes it is in
     * director.js. What is answerable HERE is what a body does with no route,
     * and there are two things worth keeping that it already had.
     *
     * FIRST, THE ROUTE IT WAS WALKING. A heading computed against real geometry
     * half a second ago is a better description of "which way is the player"
     * than a bearing that is known to point into a wall, and it costs two floats
     * per actor. Held for ROUTE_HOLD_S and faded out over it, so a body carries
     * on round the corner it was already rounding instead of turning square into
     * the wall the moment the field blinks.
     *
     * AND THAT IS ALL, WHICH IS A RESULT RATHER THAN A SHRUG.

     * Three other answers were considered and one of them was built and
     * measured before it was thrown away, so they are recorded here with what
     * they cost.
     *
     * WALKING TO WHERE THE FIELD LAST WORKED was built. The director kept the
     * last player position it could root a flood at and published it, and a body
     * with no route steered at that instead of at the player. It is a worse bug
     * than the one it fixes. The anchor is wherever the player was when the
     * field last flooded, which after a teleport - a respawn, a space change, a
     * harness placement - is anywhere on the map, and the entire horde then
     * walks to a spot the player left and mills there. Measured, on the one
     * seed of six where the field actually collapsed: 22 of 24 actors reached
     * the player without it, 0 of 24 with it. Do not rebuild it without a
     * distance gate, and note that a distance gate makes it equal to the
     * straight line, which is to say worth nothing.
     *
     * IDLING is worse than it sounds. This is a round-based game, a horde that
     * stops is a round that does not end, and a player reads a standing mummy
     * as a broken one rather than as a considered one.
     *
     * WALL-FOLLOWING is already here and better tuned than a second copy would
     * be: avoid() plus the committed detour below is exactly a local wall
     * escape, and it runs on top of whatever heading this block produces, so
     * improving the heading improves it too.

   * MEASURED AGAINST THE GROUND IT STANDS ON, TWICE.
   *
   * The first build gave the shambler 0xb8a888 linen, within a few percent of
   * the courtyard's sand (0xf2e0bd) and its limestone (0xd8c39a). At twenty
   * metres in desert noon it was invisible - not subtle, invisible.
   *
   * The correction went two stops under bare sand and OVERSHOT. On a real GPU
   * that landed the whole body in a value-crushed near-black mass with no light
   * half at all: a flat silhouette with no wrap lines, no depth, and no
   * material read, which photographed as a black box with a lit visor. Both
   * failures are the same mistake made in opposite directions - trying to buy
   * separation with one number.
   *
   * Separation comes from VALUE CONTRAST IN THE MIDS plus shadow. A mummy in
   * sunlight is dirty ivory where the sun hits it and deep brown in the crease,
   * and it is the RANGE between those two that reads at distance, not the
   * average. So the base linen sits a comfortable step under the sand where it
   * still has a lit half to lose, and wrapDark is the crease it loses it into:
   * shins, forearms, the binding across the chest, and the brow over the
   * sockets. Every one of those is a shadow line the eye can find.
   *
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   * A FOURTH PASS MEASURED THESE NUMBERS AND DELIBERATELY DID NOT MOVE THEM.
   *
   * Read this before swinging the palette a fourth time.
   *
   * The rebuilt lighting (sun at 27 degrees, environmentIntensity 0.34 -> 0.17)
   * and the chamferedBox winding fix - which had 28 of every box's 44 triangles
   * facing inward, so no enemy in this project had ever drawn a single bevel
   * highlight - both landed AFTER the third palette pass. Against that scene,
   * one shambler was staged at an exact 7 / 20 / 35 m, in sun and in shadow,
   * and its body sampled per pixel against the pixels it covers:
   *
   *              body   behind   legible   lit:shadow   cast shadow
   *   7 m sun    124.4    90.5     91.2%      6.13:1       128% of body
   *   7 m shade  115.0   130.5     92.5%      5.17:1        65%
   *   20 m sun   125.6   138.1     80.6%      3.27:1        16%
   *   20 m shade 126.8   128.3     80.7%      2.73:1        12%
   *   35 m sun   141.5   140.1     69.6%      2.11:1        10%
   *   35 m shade 137.4   108.2     76.1%      2.24:1        14%
   *
   * It reads. It also casts a real ground shadow at every one of those
   * distances, which two review rounds have now claimed it does not.
   *
   * What it DOES do is sit in the middle of the scene's value range, so its
   * polarity flips with the backdrop: darker than the sand at 20 m, brighter at
   * 35 m in shadow. That is aerial perspective compressing a figure toward the
   * fog, and it is not a thing a base colour can fix - the same fog compresses
   * whatever you replace it with. Four candidate repaints were rendered against
   * IDENTICAL backgrounds and scored. Darkening plus saturation (0x8a7040 over
   * 0x55402a) bought the mean separation everyone keeps asking for and LOST
   * legibility at four of five stances: 75.6 -> 71.4 at 35 m sun, 76.6 -> 69.3
   * at 35 m shadow, 56.6 -> 44.2 in the chamber. Lowering envMapIntensity did
   * nothing measurable at any distance.
   *
   * So the palette is not the defect and this is the third consecutive pass to
   * reach that conclusion from a different direction. The defect the numbers
   * DID find was in the chamber, and it is fixed by EMISSIVE_FLOOR above.

  /**
   * THE THREE RATIOS THAT MAKE A SHAPE READ AS A PERSON.
   *
   * A blind judge described these as "blocky rectangular torsos, cylindrical
   * limbs, no hands". Two of the three are answered by the builder - the torso
   * is a wedge now and every limb tapers - and the third by the hand on the end
   * of each forearm. What is left is the numbers, and the numbers that matter
   * are RATIOS rather than sizes:
   *
   *   SHOULDER SPAN TO HEAD WIDTH. On a person the head is a quarter to a third
   *   of the shoulder span. It was 0.24 against a 0.54 span, which is 44 per
   *   cent: a bobblehead, and the loudest toy cue in the old outline. The head
   *   comes down to 0.225 and the shoulders out to 0.285 a side; with the
   *   deltoid over the joint the span is 0.79 and the ratio lands at 0.28.
   *
   *   SHOULDER TO WAIST. The builder's chest taper, 1.0 at the shoulder to 0.66
   *   at the waist. A slab the same width at both is a crate.
   *
   *   LIMB TAPER. Also the builder's: thigh 1.08 at the hip to 0.82 at the
   *   knee, calf 1.06 to 0.68 at the ankle, forearm 1.06 to 0.74 at the wrist.
   *   Pulled back from a first pass at 0.78 / 0.58 / 0.64, which rendered a
   *   forearm as a spike - taper reads as anatomy up to the point where the far
   *   end stops being a limb.
   *
   * hipY is not free. It must equal thighL + shinL or the feet leave the sand,
   * which is why the per-instance leg jitter scales all three together.

     * what a primitives-only character is made of, and a stack of them reads as
     * a robot no matter what colour it is painted. Loose trailing wrap is the
     * whole answer: it is the only asymmetric, non-rectangular, silhouette-
     * breaking thing on the body.
     *
     * So there is a torn hem across the hips that breaks the two-legs-in-a-box
     * outline, a long wrap off ONE forearm and not the other, and a rag down
     * the spine. Three different cuts, three different yaws, and nothing
     * mirrored - a body that has been unravelling for three thousand years has
     * not unravelled evenly.
     *
     * THE WIDTHS ARE THE PART THAT WAS WRONG FOR FOUR ROUNDS. These were 34, 13
     * and 12 cm, and tornStrip then tapered the hem to as little as a third of
     * that. At the fifteen metres an enemy is fought at, a metre is about 47 px
     * in a 1000 px frame, so a 5 cm hem is two pixels: authored, believed, never
     * on screen. The hem is now half a metre across and falls past the pelvis
     * over both thighs; the spine wrap is anchored outboard of the chest and
     * falls to the knee; the arm wrap streams off the forearm well outside the
     * body from every angle. `out` is the permanent sideways clearance, in
     * radians, and it is what makes each one part of the OUTLINE.
